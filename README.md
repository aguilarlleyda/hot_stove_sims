# Exploration-exploitation choices and the hot stove effect: a simulation-based approach
 To maximize reward when repeatedly choosing among alternatives, humans build an estimate of each alternative’s value, understood as its expected outcome. But this creates a dilemma between exploitation, or making choices in order to reap reward from the alternative whose value is believed to be highest, and exploration, or choosing in order to gain information on the value of potentially better alternatives. Some evidence suggests humans solve such dilemma by choosing very similarly to softmax algorithms, where value-based choices are combined with a tendency for exploration controlled by a temperature (
) parameter. The present project simulates a series of agents making value-based choices between two alternatives for reward. By varying the 
 parameter in their softmax, these agents exhibit differences in their rate of choices of the most rewarding alternative. However, the agents reaping more reward also underestimate the alternatives’ value to a greater extent. We explain how this is due to the spontaneous appearance of the hot stove effect, whereby an alternative delivering an initial bad outcome prevents further choices of that alternative, leading to an underestimation of its value. In our context, this creates the aforementioned dissociation where better value estimates do not translate into better choices.
